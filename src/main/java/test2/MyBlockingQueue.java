/**
 * - Concurrency:
 * Use java concurrency packages to write a queue that supports multi-writer and multi-reader,
 * i.e. the writer pushes the stuff into the queue and the reader pops the stuff out the queue.
 * All the writer's stuff can't be lost and must be into the queue, and each reader can't pops out the same stuff.
 * Think of how you would simulate the situation and perform the testing. Using the java blocking queue is not allowed.
 * Design:
 * 1) Design LinkedList as Queue
 * 2ï¼‰Use concurrency package "ReentrantLock" to implement detail lock
